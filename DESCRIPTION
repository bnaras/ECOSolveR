Description: R interface to the Embedded COnic Solver (ECOS), an efficient
	     and robust C library for convex problems. Conic and equality
	     constraints can be specified in addition to integer and
	     boolean variable constraints for mixed-integer problems. This
	     R interface is inspired by the python interface and has
	     similar calling conventions.
