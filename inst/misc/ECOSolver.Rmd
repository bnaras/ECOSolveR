## Introduction

ECOS is a numerical software for solving convex second-order cone programs (SOCPs) of type
$$
min  c^{\top}x\\
\mbox{s.t.} Ax = b\\
G*x <=_K h
$$

where the last inequality is generalized, i.e. $h - G*x$ belongs to the cone $K.$ ECOS supports the
positive orthant $R_+$ and second-order cones $Q_n$ defined as
$$
Q_n = { (t,x) | t >= || x ||_2 }
$$
In the definition above, $t$ is a scalar and $x$ is in R_{n-1}. The cone K is therefore a direct product of the positive orthant and second-order cones:
K = R_+ x Q_n1 x ... x Q_nN
A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map from one algebraic
structure to another; see
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism). Privacy
experts are interested in homomorphic computation because it offers a
way to perform computations on encrypted data, either in a distributed
setting or in the cloud, thereby handling many of the headaches
associated with storing/moving/anonymizing data. Homomorphic
computation also finds application in secure voting, verifyable
computing etc.

A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that provides such a
homomorphism along with the infrastructure to carry out the
computations. The schemes provide algorithms for generating public and
private keys. The public key is distributed to anyone and the private
key is only needed by the one who does the decryption. There are
several such schemes documented in
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption). The
main thing to know is that there are two flavours: partial and
full. Partial schemes preserve structure for certain specified
operations, say addition only, whereas full schemes do over all the
standard arithmetic operations. The operations mentioned here are all
in the context of the algebraic structure underneath, which for our
purposes will be modular arithmetic where the modulus is some large
number.

The current package `homomorpheR` implements the Paillier system which
is a partially homomorphic; it provides an additive homomorphism. The
implementation here borrows much from the Javascript implementation
for a proof-of-concept system. Therefore, it is not yet ready for
serious work. So there, you've been warned.

If you are interested in the mathematical details of the Paillier
crytosystem, the main reference is [@Paillier99]. Volkhausen
[-@volkhausen2006] provides a detailed mathematical introduction;
Michael O'Keefe [-@okeefe2008] is a gentler one. A simple application
of the Paillier system for secure vote tallying is in
[@choinyaambu2009].

A bit of notation helps. Let $x$ be any message; for us, it is just a
large integer. Denote $E(x)$ as the encrypted message and $D(x)$ as
the decryption of $x$ in some scheme. If the scheme is homomorphic
over addition, then we have $$ E(x) + E(y) = E(x + y) $$

This means that calculating $x+y$ can be done by decrypting the sum of
the encrypted values of $x$ and $y$. Thus, entities can merely
exchange encrypted values throughout.  This is pictorially shown in
the figure (source:

## Facilities

As a first step, a public and private key pair needs to be generated.
In generating bits for cryptosystems, a secure random number source is
needed; `homomorpheR` makes use of the R package `sodium` by Jeroen
Ooms (based on Daniel J. Bernstein's generators) in addition to `gmp`
for arbitrary precision arithmetic.

```{r}
keyPair <- PaillierKeyPair$new(modulusBits = 1024)
```

Examine the `keyPair` object:

```{r}
keyPair
```

The `pubkey` field can be distributed all interested parties but the
private key, obtainable by `getPrivateKey()` should be kept secret for
decryption.

The main functions are the `encrypt` function for the public key, and
the `decrypt` function for the private key.

## Some tests

We can now perform some simple tests. But before that a simple
function that encrypts and decrypts.

```{r}
encryptAndDecrypt <- function(x) keyPair$getPrivateKey()$decrypt(keyPair$pubkey$encrypt(x))
```

Now we can encrypt and decrypt some numbers.

```{r}
a <- gmp::as.bigz(1273849)
identical(a + 10, encryptAndDecrypt(a + 10))
```

Now with a large set of numbers. The function `random.bigz` returns
large random numbers.

```{r}
m <- lapply(1:100, function(x) random.bigz(nBits = 512))
md <- lapply(m, encryptAndDecrypt)
identical(m, md)
```
