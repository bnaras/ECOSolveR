R interface to ECOS Embedded COnic Solver library
 
Upon installation, the bundled ecos code is built and linked, otherwise the user can supply
the location of the ecos installation directory. The three ways to install this package are

1) By default the bundled ecos code is used:

R CMD INSTALL <ECOSolveR tar ball>


2) Otherwise, the user can provide the location of the ecos installation directory

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-ecos=<location of ecos DIR>" <ECOSolveR tar ball>

Compiler flags for csdp can be given using --with-ecos-cflags as part of --configure-args

However, at the time of this package creation, ecos libraries have not been packaged for
various OS's so step 2 is unchecked at this time.
